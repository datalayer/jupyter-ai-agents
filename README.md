ü™ê ‚ú® AI Agents for JupyterLab with üõ†Ô∏è MCP tools - Chat interface for intelligent notebook interaction, code execution, and workspace management.

## üí¨ Chat Interface

Experience seamless AI-powered assistance directly within JupyterLab through our intuitive chat interface:

![Jupyter AI Agents Chat 1](https://assets.datalayer.tech/jupyter-ai-agents/jupyter-ai-agents-chat-1.png)

The chat interface is built using [Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) for robust AI agent orchestration and [Vercel AI Elements](https://github.com/vercel/ai-elements) for the user interface components.

### MCP Server Integration

By default, the [Jupyter MCP Server](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server) is started as a Jupyter server extension, providing access to all Jupyter MCP server tools directly through the chat interface. This enables the AI agent to interact with notebooks, execute code, manage files, and perform various Jupyter operations seamlessly.

### Getting Started with Chat

Currently, we support **Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.0** as the AI model. To get started:

1. **Set up your environment:**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

2. **Install Jupyter AI Agents:**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter_ai_agents
   pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
   pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
   ```

3. **Launch JupyterLab with the required configuration:**
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. **Access the chat interface** through the right panel in JupyterLab.

### What's Coming Next

We're actively working on expanding the capabilities of Jupyter AI Agents:

- üöÄ **More LLM Providers**: Integration with additional AI model providers
- ‚öôÔ∏è **MCP Configuration**: Enhanced MCP server configuration options
- üîß **Extended Tool Access**: Chat access to tools from other MCP servers
- üõ†Ô∏è **Enhanced Features**: And much more!

Check out our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ai-agents/issues) to see what we're working on. **Contributions are welcome!**

> **Note**: The documentation at https://jupyter-ai-agents.datalayer.tech will be updated soon to reflect the new chat features and capabilities.

## CLI Usage

You can also use Jupyter AI Agents through the command line interface for automated notebook operations.

![Jupyter AI Agents CLI](https://assets.datalayer.tech/jupyter-ai-agent/ai-agent-prompt-demo-terminal.gif)

### Basic Installation

To install Jupyter AI Agents, run the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyter_ai_agents
pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
```

Or clone this repository and install it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ai-agents
cd jupyter-ai-agents
pip install -e .
```

### JupyterLab Setup

The Jupyter AI Agents can directly interact with JupyterLab. The modifications made by the Jupyter AI Agents can be seen in real-time thanks to [Jupyter Real Time Collaboration](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/rtc.html). Make sure you have JupyterLab installed with the Collaboration extension:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab==4.4.1 jupyter-collaboration==4.0.2
```

We ask you to take additional actions to overcome limitations and bugs of the pycrdt library. Ensure you create a new shell after running the following commands:

```bash
pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
```
### Examples

Jupyter AI Agents provides CLI commands to help your JupyterLab session using **Pydantic AI agents** with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for tool integration.

Start JupyterLab, setting a `port` and a `token` to be reused by the agent, and create a notebook `notebook.ipynb`.

```bash
# make jupyterlab
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN
```

Jupyter AI Agents supports multiple AI model providers (more information can be found on [this documentation page](https://jupyter-ai-agents.datalayer.tech/docs/models)).

Make sure you have your API key set:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
# Or for other providers:
# export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
# export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
# etc.
```

### Model Specification

You can specify the model in two ways:

1. **Using `--model` with full string** (recommended):
   ```bash
   --model "openai:gpt-4o"
   --model "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-0"
   --model "azure-openai:deployment-name"
   ```

2. **Using `--model-provider` and `--model-name`**:
   ```bash
   --model-provider openai --model-name gpt-4o
   --model-provider anthropic --model-name claude-sonnet-4-0
   ```

Supported providers: `openai`, `anthropic`, `azure-openai`, `github-copilot`, `google`, `bedrock`, `groq`, `mistral`, `cohere`

### Prompt Agent

Create and execute code based on user instructions:

```bash
# Using full model string (recommended)
jupyter-ai-agents prompt \
  --url http://localhost:8888 \
  --token MY_TOKEN \
  --model "openai:gpt-4o" \
  --path notebook.ipynb \
  --input "Create a matplotlib example"

# Using provider and model name
jupyter-ai-agents prompt \
  --url http://localhost:8888 \
  --token MY_TOKEN \
  --model-provider anthropic \
  --model-name claude-sonnet-4-0 \
  --path notebook.ipynb \
  --input "Create a pandas dataframe with sample data and plot it"
```

### Explain Error Agent

Analyze and fix notebook errors:

```bash
jupyter-ai-agents explain-error \
  --url http://localhost:8888 \
  --token MY_TOKEN \
  --model "openai:gpt-4o" \
  --path notebook.ipynb \
  --current-cell-index 5
```

### REPL Mode (Recommended for Interactive Use)

For a more flexible interactive experience with direct access to all Jupyter MCP tools, use the REPL mode:

```bash
jupyter-ai-agents repl \
  --url http://localhost:8888 \
  --token MY_TOKEN \
  --model "openai:gpt-4o"
```

In REPL mode, you can directly ask the AI to:
- List notebooks in directories
- Read and analyze notebook contents
- Execute code in cells
- Insert new cells
- Modify existing cells
- Install Python packages

Example REPL interactions:

```
> List all notebooks in the current directory
> Create a new notebook called analysis.ipynb
> In analysis.ipynb, create a cell that imports pandas and loads data.csv
> Execute the cell and show me the first 5 rows
> Add a matplotlib plot showing the distribution of the 'age' column
```

The REPL provides all the special commands:
- `/exit`: Exit the session
- `/markdown`: Show last response in markdown format
- `/multiline`: Toggle multiline input mode (use Ctrl+D to submit)
- `/cp`: Copy last response to clipboard

You can also use a custom system prompt:

```bash
jupyter-ai-agents repl \
  --url http://localhost:8888 \
  --token MY_TOKEN \
  --model "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-0" \
  --system-prompt "You are a data science expert specializing in pandas and matplotlib."
```

## Uninstall

### About the Technology

Jupyter AI Agents empowers **AI** models to **interact** with and **modify Jupyter Notebooks**. The agent is equipped with tools such as adding code cells, inserting markdown cells, executing code, enabling it to modify the notebook comprehensively based on user instructions or by reacting to the Jupyter notebook events.

This Agent is **innovative** as it is designed to **operate on the entire Notebook**, not just at the cell level, enabling more comprehensive and seamless modifications.

The Agent can also run separately from the Jupyter server as the communication is achieved through RTC via the [Jupyter NbModel Client](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-nbmodel-client) and the [Jupyter Kernel Client](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-kernel-client).
