# Use Cases

**Jupyter AI Agents supports both interactive and automated workflows.**

## UI Use Cases

**[Conversational interface](/ui) for interactive JupyterLab development:**

### Interactive Development

- **Notebook Creation**: "Create a new notebook for analyzing the sales data with pandas and matplotlib imports"
- **Code Generation**: "Add a cell that loads the CSV file and displays the first 10 rows"
- **Data Visualization**: "Create a bar chart showing revenue by product category"
- **Code Explanation**: "Explain what the code in cell 3 does"
- **Debugging**: "This cell is throwing a KeyError. Can you help me fix it?"

### Code Quality

- **Refactoring**: "Refactor the code in cell 5 to use functions instead of inline operations"
- **Optimization**: "Improve the performance of this data processing code"
- **Documentation**: "Add docstrings to all functions in the current notebook"
- **Testing**: "Generate unit tests for the functions in this notebook"

### Learning & Exploration

- **Tutorial Creation**: "Create a tutorial notebook for web scraping with BeautifulSoup"
- **Concept Explanation**: "Explain how gradient descent works with code examples"
- **Best Practices**: "Show me the best way to handle missing data in this dataset"
- **Library Usage**: "Demonstrate how to use scikit-learn for classification"

## CLI Use Cases

**[Command-line tools](/cli) for automation and CI/CD:**

### Automated Data Analysis

- Generate analysis notebooks from data files
- Process multiple datasets with consistent pipelines
- Verify data quality and generate validation reports
- Run periodic analyses and update result notebooks

### Error Debugging

- Scan notebooks for common errors
- Identify problems and generate fixes
- Validate notebooks execute after changes
- Generate detailed error reports with context

### Notebook Operations

- Execute specific cells across multiple notebooks
- Update notebook metadata programmatically
- Ensure notebooks follow team coding standards
- Remove outputs/execution counts for version control

### CI/CD Integration

- Verify notebooks before committing
- Incorporate notebook testing in build workflows
- Create documentation from notebook content
- Enforce code quality standards

## Advanced Use Cases

### Real-Time Collaboration

- **Pair Programming**: Multiple developers work with the same agent simultaneously
- **Live Code Review**: Agent modifications visible to all collaborators in real-time
- **Team Training**: Instructor uses agent to demonstrate concepts to students
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Agent-generated notebooks shared instantly across team

### Research Workflows

- **Experiment Automation**: "Run parameter sweep for learning rates [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]"
- **Results Documentation**: "Summarize the experiment results in a markdown cell"
- **Literature Integration**: "Add citations for the methods used in this analysis"
- **Reproducibility**: "Create a setup cell with all dependencies and random seeds"

### Data Science Pipelines

- **ETL Automation**: "Extract data from the API, transform it, and save to CSV"
- **Feature Engineering**: "Create interaction features between numeric columns"
- **Model Training**: "Train a random forest classifier on this dataset"
- **Performance Evaluation**: "Generate a confusion matrix and classification report"
