# Overview

**Jupyter AI Agents** is a flexible and powerful solution for creating and deploying **✨ AI Agents** that interact with **📓 Jupyter Notebooks** through both a conversational **chat interface** and **command-line tools**.

:::info

**Jupyter AI Agents** empowers **AI models** to **interact** with, **modify**, and **understand** Jupyter Notebooks through natural language and automated workflows.

:::

Equipped with [MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools](/tools), the agent can add cells, execute code, manage files, and comprehensively modify notebooks based on user instructions or by reacting to notebook and kernel events.

## UI

Experience seamless AI assistance directly within JupyterLab through an intuitive conversational interface powered by Pydantic AI and Vercel AI Elements.

![Jupyter AI Agents UI](https://assets.datalayer.tech/jupyter-ai-agents/jupyter-ai-agents-chat-1.png)

The UI provides:
- **Natural Language Interaction**: Ask questions and give instructions in plain English
- **MCP Tool Integration**: Automatic access to Jupyter MCP Server tools for notebook operations
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Watch AI responses appear as they're generated
- **Visual Feedback**: See tool execution status and results in real-time

## CLI Tools

For automated workflows and scripting, use the command-line interface to interact with notebooks programmatically.

![Jupyter AI Agents CLI](https://assets.datalayer.tech/jupyter-ai-agents/ai-agent-prompt-demo-terminal.gif)

The CLI enables:
- **Automated Data Analysis**: Generate and execute Python scripts
- **Error Debugging**: Identify and fix errors with AI assistance  
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple notebooks efficiently
- **CI/CD Integration**: Incorporate AI agents into your development pipelines

## What is an AI Agent?

An artificial intelligence (AI) agent is a system that **autonomously performs tasks** by designing workflows and **using tools**.

Beyond processing language, these agents make decisions, solve problems, interact with environments, and execute actions. They are widely used in areas like IT automation, software design, and conversational assistants.

Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents process user inputs step-by-step and call external tools as needed to tackle complex tasks effectively.

## What Makes Jupyter AI Agents Unique?

This agent is **innovative** because it operates on the **entire Notebook**, not just individual cells, enabling comprehensive and seamless modifications across your entire workspace.

### Architecture

```
Jupyter AI Agents <-----------> JupyterLab
    |
    |   (RTC Real Time Collaboration)
    |
JNC + JKC + MCP

- JNC: https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-nbmodel-client
- JKC: https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-kernel-client  
- MCP: https://modelcontextprotocol.io
```

This powerful functionality is enabled through:
- **Jupyter [NbModel Client](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-nbmodel-client)**: Direct notebook manipulation
- **Jupyter [Kernel Client](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-kernel-client)**: Code execution and kernel interaction
- **[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)**: Standardized tool interface for AI agents
- **[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev)**: Type-safe agent orchestration framework

## Key Features

- **💬 Conversational UI**: Interactive interface built into JupyterLab's right panel
- **🛠️ MCP Tool Integration**: Native support for Jupyter MCP Server tools (notebooks, code execution, file management)
- **🔄 Real-Time Collaboration**: Changes appear instantly in JupyterLab through RTC
- **🤖 Dynamic Notebook Interaction**: Add, edit, and execute cells based on natural language instructions
- **🚀 Remote Agent Execution**: Agent runs on independent compute, separate from notebook kernels
- **⚡ Event-Based Modifications**: React to kernel and notebook changes in real-time
- **📊 Advanced Jupyter Tools**: Insert cells, execute code, manage kernels, and more
- **🔌 Extensible Architecture**: Easy integration with custom tools and MCP servers

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Install Jupyter AI Agents:**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter_ai_agents
   pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
   pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
   ```

2. **Set up your API key** (currently supports Anthropic Claude):
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

3. **Launch JupyterLab:**
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. **Open the UI** from the right panel (sparkles ✨ icon)

### What's Supported
